# DPDK workshop

The provided makefile contains some helpers such as:
- `make devenv` builds a docker container with all necessary tools to build and run the project
- `make dev` will enter the dev container
- `make build` will build the project
- `make run` will run the project

Most of the coding tasks are in the `src/main.c` file. You should solve Tasks 1, 2 and 3 in order.

There are also 2 bonus tasks which require some changes to the Makefile.
